#compare our results with:

1. Semi-Supervised Learning with Ladder Networks

2. Semi-Supervised Learning with Generative Adversarial Networks

3. VAE with Semi-Supervised Learning (Max Welling)

#Experimental Setup

- Want to compare for N=100 for Q=1

- N=1000 for Q=5 

- Using the weighted_inputs in loss function to avoid overfitting for small data - in case of N=100


# SSL with Generative Adversarial Networks
